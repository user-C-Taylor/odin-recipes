Basic website to put intro html and CSS in

This website consists of three recipe pages and an index page. 

Initially it demonstrates basic boilerplate html, unordered and ordered lists, image display, a folder structure (/images/, /recipes/), linking, and use of headers and paragraphs.

Later in the Odin Project curriculum, basic CSS will be added to this website and this README will be updated.
