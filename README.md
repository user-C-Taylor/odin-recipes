Basic website to put intro HTML and CSS in

This website consists of three recipe pages and an index page. 

Initially it demonstrated basic boilerplate HTML, unordered and ordered lists, image display, a directory structure (/images/, /recipes/), linking, and use of headers and paragraphs.

The CSS employs centering with the display set to flex and using justify-content. Centering using left/right margins set to auto and a width was decided against. Bottom-margin is used. Flex-direction, align-item, and gap are used for the flex index page list. Anchor color, padding, and border are used. Images might be sized, transformed, and transitioned with a border-radius selected. ":hover" is employed. Div padding, margin-bottom, font-weight, font-size, letter-spacing, text-transform, and line-height are employed.

CSS rules might be assigned to grouped or chained selectors, or employ the descendant combinator.
