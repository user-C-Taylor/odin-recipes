        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Spicy garlic ginger tofu is easy to make and delicious. The name says it all. It's tofu pan fried with minced ginger and garlic, liberally dashed with crushed red pepper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Different kinds of tofu can be selected if you are familiar with Chinese tofu. Tea flavored tofu is one option. For this recipe, super firm tofu from you local grocery will be great.
        </p>
        <p>
            Optionally, a dash of granulated chicken bouillon can be mixed in shortly before removing the pan from the heat. A judiciously small amount of water can be added to moisten the tofu for better mixing in the bouillon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before slicing off a slice of ginger, first slice off and toss away the dried section of root. This allows you to slice off a 3mm thick slice that is fresh on two sides.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>One to three cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>A 3mm thick slice of ginger, sliced from about a 2.5cm circumference root</li>
            <li>Half a block of super firm tofu</li>
            <li>Canola oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince the garlic and ginger, keeping them separate</li>
            <li>Slice the tofu into 5mm thick slices of a size and shape convenient for eating with chopsticks</li>
            <li>Place your container of crushed red pepper near the stove for quick access</li>
            <li>Bring a dry pan to medium heat or slightly over medium heat</li>
            <li>Add a very small amount of canola oil to the pan and spread it around with a spatula</li>
            <li>Add the tofu, garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper to the pan and mix everything together with a spatula</li>
            <li>Arrange the tofu on the pan so that every piece is flat against the pan</li>
            <li>After browning the tofu to a light brown on one side (check with chopsticks), flip the tofu over with chopsticks</li>
            <li>After browning the other side of the tofu to a similar light brown, you are done</li>
            <li>Optionally add a judicious amount of water just sufficient to moisten the tofu after mixing it in</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and place the tofu in a serving dish</li>
            
        </ol>
