        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a fast and healthy recipe. Previously cooked and drained black beans are fried in a large pan with onion, garlic, and crushed red pepper. The black beans can be either freshly cooked and drained or from the fridge. My preference is for initially cooking beans with a pressure cooker rather than in a pot. But a pot is fine.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A large onion or two</li>
